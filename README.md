# Lexvo

This is a copy of Lexvo, a dataset about languages, words, characters,
and other human language-related entities to the Linked Data Web and
Semantic Web.  This dataset used to be hosted at
<http://www.lexvo.org/resources/lexvo_2013-02-09.nt.gz>.

## Why are you hosting a copy of this dataset?

We are hosing this vocabulary, since we could not find it anywhere
online anymore.  At the same time, this vocabulary is used in many
Linked Datasets in [YALC](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC), so it is
important to have a copy of this vocabulary available.
